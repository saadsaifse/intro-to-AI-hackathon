## Machine Learning Glossary

This section briefly explains all the terminologies used in this tutorial

### Tensor
The primary data structure in TensorFlow programs. Tensors are N-dimensional (where N could be very large) data structures, most commonly scalars, vectors, or matrices. The elements of a Tensor can hold integer, floating-point, or string values.

### Activation Function
A function (for example, ReLU or sigmoid) that takes in the weighted sum of all of the inputs from the previous layer and then generates and passes an output value (typically nonlinear) to the next layer.


### Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)
An activation function with the following rules:

- If input is negative or zero, output is 0.
- If input is positive, output is equal to input.


### Sigmoid function
A function that maps logistic or multinomial regression output (log odds) to probabilities, returning a value between 0 and 1.
