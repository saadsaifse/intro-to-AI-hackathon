## The ethical dilemma of self-driving cars by Patrick Lin

Patrick Lin is the director of the Ethics + Emerging Sciences Group, based at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, where he is also a philosophy professor. In the TedEd link before you Professor Lin discusses the ethics of self-driving cars. 

<b>Watch</b> the video and <b>Think</b> while answering the questions, for more information you can <b>Dig Deeper</b> and read additional articles.

## AI Bias

![alttext](https://blogs.gartner.com/anthony_bradley/files/2020/01/4-Stages-of-Ethical-AI.png)

In his article J. Bradley (2020) describes 4 stages relevant to AI bias; real world bias, data bias, algorithm bias and business bias.
1. **Real world bias** involves actual bias in real world situations such as gender bias, name bias or beauty bias. 
For example: Name bias is the tendency people have to judge and prefer people with certain types of names — typically names that are of Anglo origin. This may occur when reviewing your future classmates and some names will appear to you as 'foreign'. 
2. **Data bias** happens when the data accurately reflects the real world. If the data is reflective of the real world it will also reflect the biases that occur in the real world. 
3. **Algorithm bias**, an algorithm is a set of rules that precisely defines a sequence of operations. These rules are defined by humans and operated by machines, algorithm bias is an outcome of real world bias that humans have. 
For example: when a job application filtering tool is trained on decisions made by humans, the machine learning algorithm may learn to discriminate against women or individuals with a certain ethnic background.
4. **Bussiness bias** represents how businesses act upon the data/AI for business benefit. Mostly businesses will be bias based on relevant criteria that determines a good prospective customer, storefront geography, job candidate, product investment, etc. 

This cycle presented in the figure presents how each bias effect the other in a cause and effect flow.

## Fake AI

AI "faking" technologies make what once could have been regarded as reliable evidence into unreliable evidence. This is already happening to digital photos, sound recordings, and videos.

```
Examples: 
● People can be put in places they never visited by using photoshop.
● AI can change the way one looks by 'slimming' them down in before and after pictures advertising a  diet pill.
```
**Check out these "Fake" AI tools:**

[Face2Face](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohmajJTcpNk) - a system capable of identifying the facial expressions of a person and putting them on another person’s face in a Youtube video.  
[Lyrebird](https://www.descript.com/overdub?lyrebird=true) - a tool for automatic imitation of a person’s voice from a few minutes of sample recording.

## Privacy & Surveillance

As technology has advanced, the way in which privacy is protected and violated has changed with it. AI leads new kinds of threats to our privacy, which may be harder to avoid. AI can conduct facial analysis, skin texture analysis, speech recognition and emotion recognition. All without permission or cooperation from the individual.

**An example can be using data analysis to identify individuals**  

In China the belief is that surveillance with Facial Recognition is essential to law enforcement and public safety. Even in the United States facial recognition for law enforcement is also routinely used everywhere, except in its tech capital -  San Francisco.
