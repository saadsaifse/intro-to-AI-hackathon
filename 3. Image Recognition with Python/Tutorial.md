## Image Classification Tools

> This tutorial can be performed without installing any of the mentioned tools on your machine. However, it is encouraged to install and experiment with these tools and run the tutorial on your own machine.

There are several tool to perform machine and deep learning, but in this section, a brief introduction is provided to the tools that are used in this tutorial.

### Programming Language
The language of choice for this tutorial is Python. Mainly because it has the following advantages:

- Open Source: Python is an open source language that means anyone can use and contribute towards the development of the language and its related tools
- Simple to learn: Python is really simple to learn and also contains a lot of libraries that can be readily used to perform difficult tasks with simple function calls 
- Great for data handling: With Python, the handling of data is simple, for example reading CSV files, creating matrices, lists and arrays are quite user friendly

A basic understanding of Python is assumed for this tutorial. To learn more about Python, visit https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/. 

### TensorFlow for Machine and Deep Learning

We will perform image classification using the following tools:

- TensorFlow - an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
- Jupyter Notebook - an open-source application that allows to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text.
- Google Colaboratory - a browser-based environment that allows you to write and execute Python in your browser. Colab notebooks are Jupyter notebooks that are hosted by Colab
- Python 3 - preferred programming language for machine learning with TensorFlow
- Keras - a high-level deep-learning API for configuring neural networks.
- Other libraries - such as Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib etc.

We will perform everything in the browser so you do not have to install or perform any kind of setup on your laptop.
