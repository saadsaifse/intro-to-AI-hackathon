## Image Classification Tools

> This tutorial can be performed without installing any of the mentioned tools on your machine. However, it is encouraged to install and experiment with these tools and run the tutorial on your own machine.

There are several tool to perform machine and deep learning, but in this section, a brief introduction is provided to the tools that are used in this tutorial.

### Python Programming Language
The language of choice for this tutorial is Python. Mainly because it has the following advantages:

- Open Source: Python is an open source language that means anyone can use and contribute towards the development of the language and its related tools
- Simple to learn: Python is really simple to learn and also contains a lot of libraries that can be readily used to perform difficult tasks with simple function calls 
- Great for data handling: With Python, the handling of data is simple, for example reading CSV files, creating matrices, lists and arrays are quite user friendly

A basic understanding of Python is assumed for this tutorial. To learn more about Python, visit https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/. 

### Jupyter Notebook
The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. 
Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.
JupyterLab is a new interface for the Jupyter Notebooks and is recommended to use. You can install Jupyter Notebook and JupyerLab on your machine to use them with Python or many other languages.

To learn more about Jupyter Notebook, visit https://jupyter.org/index.html

### Google Colaboratory
While Jupyter Notebooks are a great tool to write Python code, it has to be installed. It also has a cloud based Jupyter Hub but there is a better option by Google, called Google Colab.
Google Colaboratory, or "Colab" for short, allows to write and execute Python in the browser, with

- Zero configuration required
- Free access to GPUs
- Easy sharing

Colab notebooks execute code on Google's cloud servers, meaning you can leverage the power of Google hardware, including GPUs and TPUs, regardless of the power of your machine. All you need is a browser. 

It is perfect for students, data scientists or AI researchers. To learn more about Google Colab, visit https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb#scrollTo=5fCEDCU_qrC0
