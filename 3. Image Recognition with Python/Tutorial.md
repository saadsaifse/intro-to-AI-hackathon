### TensorFlow for Machine and Deep Learning

We will perform image classification using the following tools:

- TensorFlow - an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
- Jupyter Notebook - an open-source application that allows to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text.
- Google Colaboratory - a browser-based environment that allows you to write and execute Python in your browser. Colab notebooks are Jupyter notebooks that are hosted by Colab
- Python 3 - preferred programming language for machine learning with TensorFlow
- Keras - a high-level deep-learning API for configuring neural networks.
- Other libraries - such as Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib etc.

We will perform everything in the browser so you do not have to install or perform any kind of setup on your laptop.
